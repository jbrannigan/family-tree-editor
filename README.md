# Family Tree Editor (v1.0.0-beta)

A lightweight, tab-indented text ‚Üí interactive family tree editor.  
Paste or load a `.txt` with tab-indented lines and get:

- Live **Tree View** (collapsible nodes, focus/unfocus)
- **SVG View** (auto-generated diagram; downloadable)
- **Exports**: HTML, JSON, SVG (filenames include a timestamp suffix)

> **Beta:** The layout and styling are under active polish. Core parsing & views work.

---

## Demo (Quick Start)

1. **Install**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run**
   ```bash
   npm start

4. **Use**
* Click **Choose File** or paste your tree text into the editor
* Expand/collapse nodes; click focus to isolate a branch

## Text Format
Use tabs to indicate hierachy:

```
John McGinty (1870-1909) & Margaret Kirk (1871-1906)
\tJames Lynch McGinty (1896-1950) & Theresa Curtis (1894-1952)
\t\tJohn G. McGinty (1922-1991)
\t\tLoreen (1953)
```
* Tabs are the source of truth for nesting.
* Mixed tabs/spaces are tolerated for *outdent*; prefer tabs overall.

---

## Features
* **Two-pane UI**: Editor (left) + Tree View (right); SVG Tree diagram below
* **Focus mode**: focus/unfocus any node
* **Exports**: HTML (collapsible), JSON, SVG
* **Timestamped filenames**;e.g. ```family_tree-31JUL2025-1422.html```

---

## Roadmap
* Tree View polish (grid lines, improved spacing)
* SVG layout: smarter sizing, long-text handling
* Better keyboard navigation in TreeView
* Optional space-based indentation mode

---

## Scripts
* ```npm start``` - dev server (React)
